                    <p>This is a nice stuff which i have done a while ago. I like it cos it is cool and gives me joy. So now i can put my work on my repository. Coding is something i have been aspiring to do in the time past which led me to the present stage i am right now. What coding can do you won't be able to measure the appreciation you would want to give yourself for learning it. Thanks to ABUAD Developers Community and also my fellow partner Peter Quadri who has been encouranging me.</p>
